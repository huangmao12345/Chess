# Chess:
My first real project using Python.
So far, this project consists of two files, BoardAndPieces.py and GameAndGUI.py.
It uses Tkinter and PIl imports, as well as the chess images I uploaded.
When running the project, make sure that the filepaths correspond to the location of the images when downloaded.

Features:
- Tkinter interactive GUI platform
- Click on a piece to view its legal moves, then click on a legal square to move the piece
- It is possible to castle legally
- Pawns auto-promote to Queens
- Game can result in checkmate or draw

Bugs I still have to fix:
- The kings can walk up and capture each other
- Pawns default promote to Queens when they reach the end of the board, and their image remains as pawns
- No en passant yet :(

Project start date: 10/18/2021
Version 1 finish date: 11/05/2021
